        <h1>About me</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-10">
                <p>I primarily work with a <strong>.NET stack</strong>, and comfortable with both front-end and back end development.</p>
                <h3><i class="fa fa-fw fa-database"></i> Back-end</h3>
                <p>My bread and butter is <strong>ASP.NET MVC 5</strong> with <strong>Entity Framework</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>. I am confident in creating database-driven web applications, writing web APIs and CRUD applications. I also have some experience with PHP and MongoDB. </p>
                <h3><i class="fa fa-fw fa-desktop"></i> Front-end</h3>
                <p>
                    I am very familiar writing clean, maintainable and responsive <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>. In 1999, my first web project was at the age of 12, when I was paid to develop the public-facing website for my secondary school. That site has, fortunately, been long-since deprecated!
                    Since then, I have become adept with <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong> and a host of front-end frameworks. Currently I <em>love</em> working with <strong>AngularJS</strong> to create powerful front-end driven web applications.
                </p>
                <h3><i class="fa fa-fw fa-graduation-cap"></i> Physics and mathematics</h3>
                <p> I studied for an masters degree in Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University, and a PhD in nanoscience from The University of Manchester. Although I left academia for software development, I still enjoy keeping up to date with the latest developments in science. I occassionally write posts about fundamental aspects of Physics and producing simulations of mathematical structures.  </p>

                            I have always had a keen interest in the future of computing at its most fundamental level. As computers become ever-smaller, the powerful our techology becomes. However, there is a fundamental limit to miniaturization - the limits of matter itself. At this limit, we must start to exploit quantum mechanics to perform computations.

                        <p>
                            During my PhD in the School of Chemistry, I had the opportunity to explore the magnetic properties of a series of large molecules and ascertain their potential applications for quantum computing. I performed spectroscopic studies on a series of compounds, ran detailed simulations to understand the relative magnetic properties of them, and was also involved in a project to build a custom cryostat to investigate such compounds at temperature scales below 1 Kelvin.
