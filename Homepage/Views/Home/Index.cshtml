            <h1>Morten Alexander Albring</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Hello! I'm Morten. I'm a software developer with a passion for data visualisation. I have a keen interest in the latest developments in web frameworks and building powerful web applications. </p>
                <p>I have a background in Theoretical Physics and I have a particular interest in Quantum Computing.</p>

            <p>I primarily work with a <strong>.NET stack</strong>, and comfortable with both front-end and back end development.</p>
            <h2><i class="fa fa-fw fa-database"></i> Back-end</h2>
            <p>My bread and butter is <strong>ASP.NET MVC 5</strong> with <strong>Entity Framework</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>. I am confident in creating database-driven web applications, writing web APIs and CRUD applications. I also have some experience with PHP and MongoDB. </p>
            <h2><i class="fa fa-fw fa-desktop"></i> Front-end</h2>
            <p>
                I am very familiar writing clean, maintainable and responsive <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>CSS3</strong>. In 1999, my first web project was at the age of 12, when I was paid to develop the public-facing website for my secondary school. That site has, fortunately, been long-since deprecated!
                Since then, I have become adept with <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>JQuery</strong> and a host of front-end frameworks. Currently I <em>love</em> working with <strong>AngularJS</strong> to create powerful front-end driven web applications.
            </p>
            <h2><i class="fa fa-fw fa-graduation-cap"></i> Physics and mathematics</h2>
            <p> I studied for an masters degree in Theoretical Physics at Lancaster University, and a PhD in nanoscience from The University of Manchester. Although I left academia for software development, I still enjoy keeping up to date with the latest developments in science. I occassionally write posts about fundamental aspects of Physics and producing simulations of mathematical structures.  </p>

                    <p>The Lorenz attractor is a chaotic system that arises out of three simple differential equations. This shows the POV-Ray code necessary to simulate this system. </p>
