                            If we have four anchor points, a square, we do simply get a random collection across a canvas.

                        <p>
                            This is because the points are free to move anywhere on the canvas with equal probability. They're not constrained to move away from any particular area.

                            As we increase the number of anchor points, it doesn't seem to produce any especially interesting fractal structures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, we can put an additional constraint to the rules. At the moment, we roll a die to select which anchor point we move towards. We may end up rolling the same anchor point over and over again.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So let's add the constraint:
                        </p>
                        <ul class="list-group">
                            <li class="list-group-item">
                                If we roll the same anchor point as we had on the last iteration, we roll again until we select a different one.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>
                            When playing the chaos game with the square, this simple change to the rules transforms the random collection to this remarkable fractal structure.
                        </p>
